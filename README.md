# ABEL-S.T.
ABEL S.T. is a JavaFX application that aims to become a complete security toolkit for everyday use from all of us.
Here you'll find only some samples of the source code as the application is in pre-alpha and under 'very' heavy development. 

Project's Next Steps:
  * All the UI components should be loaded by a FXML file.
  * The expanssion of application's functionality.
  * The creation of new optimised algorithms.

Thanks in advance for the interest.
